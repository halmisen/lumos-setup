# ✨ Lumos Setup

> *"Lumos!"* - A magical incantation to light up your development environment

## 🪄 About This Project

This repository demonstrates the complete setup of a **WSL Ubuntu development environment** from scratch. Just like Harry Potter's lumos spell illuminates the darkness, this project illuminates the path to creating a powerful Linux development setup on Windows.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- **Python 3.12.3** with pip package manager
- **Node.js v18.19.1** with npm 9.2.0  
- **GCC 13.3.0** compiler toolchain
- **GitHub CLI** for seamless repository management
- **Optimized package mirrors** for faster downloads
- **Organized project structure** for clean development
